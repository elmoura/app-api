MindRight API

This is the API of MindRight!

The ideia is to develop a portal to psychological help, where you can offer your service as a mental health professional
or a holistic therapist. We are here to support any kind of therapy that make people feel better with themselves!

The back-end was developed with Node.JS + MongoDB, it still in development, but these are the very first steps
of a complete application that I will develop by myself.

Any feedbacks/improvements will be welcome!
